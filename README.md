# An extravagant escapade

Hi! ABYSSESCAPADE is the second of my projects and a truly grand platformer indeed. Play as Dott, a being with a simple dream to live a better life. Stuck in god's flawed world, he wishes to travel up a dimension known as Paraslixox, a gateway between the two worlds. However, the journey will not be easy. Phasing through the gateway will prove to be a challenge, and once our hero enters the dimension, he must collect 4 relics to exit. 

As of November, ABYSSESCAPADE is still under development. However, a prototype is out at https://maymay39.itch.io/abyssescapade. Expect the full release in February 2021, I'm excited that I have the oppurtunity to develop this awesome game.
