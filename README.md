# The Escapade of Legends

Hello! Thanks for checking out this repository. ABYSS â€¢ ESCAPADE is an upcoming game, and the second release of the ABYSS series. Play as *Dott*, a little fellow with a simple dream of having a better life.

A long time ago, the god of the worlds was unhappy with the universe he created and decided to build a new, fresh world right on top of the old one. To prevent the two from knowing eachother's existance, he made a hellish dimension in between the two worlds known as **Paraslixox**. 

Eventually, too many adventurers were trying to get past Paraslixox so the god sealed the border with an ancient relic. However...

...One day, while strolling in paradise, the god of the worlds himself dropped the relic that sealed Paraslixox. **Team Impossible** accidentally stumbled upon this relic and re-opened the gate, causing a catastrophe. They reverted the god's curse over Paraslixox, preventing the world from crushing down into a ball.

Fast forward to now. Dott heard rumors
